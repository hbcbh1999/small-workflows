# Contributing
Thank you for wanting to make the workflows better. You can:
- Make suggestions and file bugs in [Issues](../../issues/).
- Fix issues and add features to any of the workflows with [Pull Requests](../../pulls/).

## Improving the workflows
If you wish that a workflow did something that it currently doesn't do or perhaps it does something wrong and you wish it was fixed, you can open an [issue](../../issues/new) saying what it is you want fixed or added. Alternatively, you can make the change yourself in the workflow, then export the workflow with something like [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) and I can take a look at it and add the changes.

## Submitting a Pull Request
Please go through [existing issues](../../issues/) and [pull requests](../../pulls/) to check if somebody else is already working on the issue.

#### Thank you for taking the time to contribute! 💜
