> Search folders from Alfred and open them in Finder/iTerm/Editor.

You can do many things with modifiers to the folders. By default it will cd to the folder path inside your currently active iTerm tab which saves me a lot of time and makes navigating the file system a dream.

You can also open the folders in the editors of your choice, for me those editors are Sublime Text and VS Code.

One of the modifier actions there (⌥ + ⏎) will open the README file inside the editor with an editor you specified (Sublime Text by default). I use this action a lot.
