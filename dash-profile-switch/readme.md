# Dash Profile Switcher - [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/dash-profile-switch/Dash%20profile%20switch.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
> Search through your custom [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) profiles.

[Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) is a wonderful documentation tool for macOS. It allows you to create profiles to scope your global searches.

It also allows you to set custom Keyword triggers to switch between these profiles.

You can customise the Dash profile keyword triggers in profile settings here:

And then you can call these triggers using this URL scheme: `dash://go:`

Where you can change `go` to the trigger you set. This workflow simply lets you create a [list filter](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/list-filter/) to search and call these URL scheme for you. Adapt it to how you like it.
